            <p>At QuickAnswerAI, we strive to provide a high-quality service for our users. If you are not completely satisfied with your subscription, we offer the following refund policy:</p>

            <h2>1. Free Trial Period</h2>

            <h2>2. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
            <p>If you wish to cancel your subscription after the trial period, you can do so at any time through your account settings. Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will continue to have access to QuickAnswerAI until that time.</p>

            <h2>3. Refund Eligibility</h2>
