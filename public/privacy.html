        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="tos-text">
            <p>Last Updated: 2024.10.02.</p>
            <p>Thank you for using QuickAnswerAI, a Chrome extension that allows users to take screenshot snippets from their screen and receive instant AI responses. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our extension.</p>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect and store the following personal information when you create an account:<br>

                Email Address: Used for account creation and communication.<br>
                Password: Stored in an encrypted, hashed form for security.<br>
                We do not collect or store any screenshots, AI responses, or any other personal data.</p>
            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your email address to:<br>
                Create and manage your account.<br>
                Send you important information regarding your account, including updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy<br>.
                Notify you about changes to pricing or features.</p>
            <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously. Your password is stored in a hashed form, meaning it is converted into a secure format that cannot be easily decrypted. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>QuickAnswerAI uses OpenAIâ€™s API to generate AI responses. By using our extension, you acknowledge that your interactions with the AI may be subject to OpenAI's own privacy policy and terms of service.</p>
            <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:<br>

                Access the personal information we hold about you.<br>
                Request correction of any inaccurate or incomplete information.<br>
                Request deletion of your account and associated data. To do this, please contact us at bator.karpathegyi@gmail.com.
                </p>
            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>QuickAnswerAI is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>
            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective when we post the revised policy on this page. We will notify you via email if there are significant changes. Your continued use of the extension after any modifications to the Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
            <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
